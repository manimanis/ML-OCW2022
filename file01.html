    <h1>Introduction to ML</h1>
    <p>The main focus of machine learning is <i>making decisions</i> or <i>predictions</i> based on data.</p>
    <p>There are a number of other fields with significant overlap in technique, but difference in focus: in economics
      and psychology, the goal is to discover underlying causal processes and in statistics it is to find a model that
      fits a data set well.</p>
    <p>In those fields, the end product is a model. In machine learning, we often fit models, but as a mean to the end
      of
      making good predictions or decisions.</p>
    <p>As machine-learning (ML) methods have improved in their capability and scope, ML has become the best way,
      measured in terms of speed, human engineering time, and robustness, to make many applications. Great examples are
      face detection and speech recognition and many kinds of language-processing tasks. Almost any application that
      involves understanding data or signals that come from the real world can be best addressed using machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>One crucial aspect of machine learning approaches to solving problems is that human engineering plays an
      important role. A human still has to frame the problem:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>acquire and organize data,</li>
      <li>design a space of possible solutions,</li>
      <li>select a learning algorithm and its parameters,</li>
      <li>apply the algorithm to the data,</li>
      <li>validate the resulting solution to decide whether it's good enough to use,</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The conceptual basis of learning from data is the problem of induction: <b>Why do we think that previously seen
        data will help us predict the future?</b> This is a serious philosophical problem of long standing.</p>
    <p>We will operationalize it by making assumptions, such as that all training data are IID (independent and
      identically distributed) and that queries will be drawn from the same distribution as the training data, or that
      the answer comes from a set of possible answers known in advance.</p>
    <p>In general, we need to solve these two problems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>estimation:</b> When we have data that are noisy reflections of some underlying quantity of interest, we
        have to aggregate the data and make estimates or predictions about the quantity. How do we deal with the fact
        that, for example, the same treatment may end up with different results on different trials? How can we predict
        how well an estimate may compare to future results?</li>
      <li><b>generalization:</b> How can we predict results of a situation or experiment that we have never encountered
        before in our data set?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can describe problems and their solutions using six characteristics, three of which characterize the problem
      and three of which characterize the solution:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Problem class:</b> What is the nature of the training data and what kinds of queries will be made at
        testing time?</li>
      <li><b>Assumptions:</b> What do we know about the source of the data or the form of the solution?</li>
      <li><b>Evaluation criteria:</b> What is the goal of the prediction or estimation system? How will the answers to
        individual queries be evaluated? How will the overall performance of the system be measured?</li>
      <li><b>Model type:</b> Will an intermediate model be made? What aspects of the data will be modeled? How will the
        model be used to make predictions?</li>
      <li><b>Model class:</b> What particular parametric class of models will be used? What criterion will we use to
        pick a particular model from the model class?</li>
      <li><b>Algorithm:</b> What computational process will be used to fit the model to the data and/or to make
        predictions?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Without making some assumptions about the nature of the process generating the data, we cannot perform
      generalization. In the following sections, we elaborate on these ideas.</p>
